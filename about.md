##Unemployment in Europe Explorer

The aplication is based on the data collected by [Eurostat](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat)
The indicator focuses on the 15 to 74 years old. It shows the "probability" of being without a job for those who would like to have one, broken-down by educational attainment level and gender. The indicator provides a measure of difficulties that people with different levels of education have to face in the labour market and offers a first idea of the impact of education in reducing the chances of being unemployed.
The educational attainment level is coded according to the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED). Data until 2013 are classified according to ISCED 1997 and data as from 2014 according to ISCED 2011.
•	Less than primary, primary and lower secondary education (ISCED levels 0-2)
•	Upper secondary and post-secondary non-tertiary education (ISCED levels 3 and 4)
•	Tertiary education (ISCED levels 5-8) (ISCED 1997: levels 5 and 6)
The gender is coded as "Male", "Female" and "Total".

The dataset has been obtained from [link](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/lfs/data/main-tables#).
